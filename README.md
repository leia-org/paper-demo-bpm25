# *A training framework for BPM Modeling interviews based on LLM assistants* - Supplementary material

This repository contains the supplementary material of the paper entitled "A training framework for BPM Modeling interviews based on LLM assistants", submitted to BPM 2025. 

<br>

## ü§ñ  **BPM-LEIA** 
**BPM-LEIA** (BPM Learning-Enabling Intelligent Assistant) is an AI-powered tool designed to simulate realistic process domain expert interviews for training students to gather the information needed to build an accurate process model.

<br>

## üöÄ Access the Tool  
üîó [Try the BPM-LEIA tool](https://bit.ly/leia3)

To interact with the BPM-LEIA, students access the LEIA-WorkBench via a dedicated link. They must enter an email address to identify their session and a code for the preconfigured interview exercise assigned by the instructor.

## üìù List of available exercises
To build the examples provided with the tool, we used the descriptions and models provided for some of the exercises present in [1].

### Order management process

* **Code**: RMCEHF59FZAUNSP5O
* **Process**: Order fulfillment process

    ![Order fulfillment process in BPMN](https://github.com/leia-org/paper-demo-bpm25/process-exercises/order-fulfillment/order-fulfillment-process-model.png)

    The order fulfillment process starts whenever a purchase order has been received from a customer. The first activity that is carried out is checking if the product is in stock, otherwise the process completes by rejecting the order. Further, if the product is in stock, the product is requested from the warehouse and the order is  confirmed. Afterwards, the requested product is shipped (after the shipment address is received so that the product can be shipped to the customer) while the invoice is emitted and the payment is received. Afterwards, only when the shipment is completed and the payment has been received, the order is archived and the process completes.

### Assessing loan application process

* **[Link](https://leia-workbench-front-v3-a393ff9e36a2.herokuapp.com/?email=_test_bd&code=RMCE6KT00UY2V986Y)** to the interview exercise on the _loan application process_. 
* **Code**: RMCE6KT00UY2V986Y
* **Process**: Assessing loan application process

    ![Assessing loan application process in BPMN](https://github.com/leia-org/paper-demo-bpm25/process-exercises/assessing-loan-application/assessing-loan-application-process-model.png)

    A loan application is approved if it passes two checks: (i) the applicant‚Äôs loan risk assessment, done automatically by a system, and (ii) the appraisal of the property for which the loan has been asked, carried out by a property appraiser. The risk assessment requires a credit history check on the applicant, which is performed by a financial officer. Once both the loan risk assessment and the property appraisal have been performed, a loan officer can assess the applicant‚Äôs eligibility. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected, otherwise the acceptance pack is prepared and sent to the applicant.
