# *A training framework for BPM Modeling interviews based on LLM assistants* - Supplementary material

This repository contains the supplementary material of the paper entitled "A training framework for BPM Modeling interviews based on LLM assistants", submitted to BPM 2025. 

## ü§ñ  **BPM-LEIA** 
**BPM-LEIA** (BPM Learning-Enabling Intelligent Assistant) is an AI-powered tool designed to simulate realistic process domain expert interviews for training students to gather the information needed to build an accurate process model.

## üìù List of available exercises
In order to try the BPM-LEIA, we have develop the following examples that correspond with exercises present in the book **Fundamentals of Business Process Management** [[1]]([README.md#-references).

### Assessing loan application process (*Exercise 3.2, page 84. Process model solution, page 109.*)

* **Exercise Code**: RMCE6KT00UY2V986Y
* **Process**: Assessing loan application process

    ![Assessing loan application process in BPMN](process-exercises/assessing-loan-application/assessing-loan-application-process-model.png)

    A loan application is approved if it passes two checks: (i) the applicant‚Äôs loan risk assessment, done automatically by a system, and (ii) the appraisal of the property for which the loan has been asked, carried out by a property appraiser. The risk assessment requires a credit history check on the applicant, which is performed by a financial officer. Once both the loan risk assessment and the property appraisal have been performed, a loan officer can assess the applicant‚Äôs eligibility. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected, otherwise the acceptance pack is prepared and sent to the applicant.

### Order management process (*Example 3.4, solution in Figure 3.6, page 83.*)

* **Exercise Code**: RMCEHF59FZAUNSP5O
* **Process**: Order fulfillment process

    ![Order fulfillment process in BPMN](process-exercises/order-fulfillment/order-fulfillment-process-model.PNG)

    The order fulfillment process starts whenever a purchase order has been received from a customer. The first activity that is carried out is checking if the product is in stock, otherwise the process completes by rejecting the order. Further, if the product is in stock, the product is requested from the warehouse and the order is  confirmed. Afterwards, the requested product is shipped (after the shipment address is received so that the product can be shipped to the customer) while the invoice is emitted and the payment is received. Afterwards, only when the shipment is completed and the payment has been received, the order is archived and the process completes.
